#### Option 1: Student progress

Question:

Total of 20 students

- 5 students are behind (group C)
- 10 are at risk of falling behind (group B)
- 5 are ahead (group A)

Create an intervention plan to get everyone on the same level

Answer:

As a tutor I've dealt with a simialr situation where 30+ students were behind on ther task and about 20 were barely keeping up to meet expected deadlines. I noticed a few were handling thing quite well and were ahead of schedule, myself included.

I spoke with the students that were ahead and gathered 3 students to help me tutor those that were lagging behind. Our aim was not to do the tasks for them but to guide them and for them to learn how to do it themselves.

I think the same can be applied to this situation. I always encourage peer-to-peer learning as it benefits both sides.

Method 1: Group learning
Assuming each task needs to be done in order..
I'd start with GROUP C that are behind. If possible I could suggest GROUP A help GROUP C in 1-on-1 meetings. This will benefit both sides as it will allow collaboration which is necessary in the work space. It will aslo improve the understanding of GROUP A as well as push GROUP C forward in terms are progress where they're all on the same level. Meanwhile I would be doing group meetingS with GROUP B to try and get them some what ahead of schedule.

When GROUP C are all on the same level I will start with different type of group meetings, this one will include both GROUP B and C. In these meetings I will test both GROUPS B and C. GROUP B will assist with explanation to test their understanding on the topics I helped them with. GROUP C will be taught the same as I taught GROUP B in their group meetings, but I will also have to test whether or not they understand the work GROUP A taught them.

Method 2: Chain learning
Assuming each task can be done at random..
I'd list each task in order of demand and work my way down through group meetings. This way majority of the class will be helped from the begining

These methods helped me with an extremely large number of students so working with a class of 20 will be simplier.

#### Option 3: Student feedback

Question:

A student claims feedback is gerneric and posted a complaint on social media platform

How would you handle this situation?

Answer:

When resolving conflict I usually follow these steps

- Identify the prolem
- Understand why the problem was cause
- Explain both sides to one another
- Resolve the problem
- Suggest ways to prevent it in the future

Assuming the feedback was done over a text this approach will be verbally to avoid any misunderstanding

step 1: Student was not satisfied with the feed back as they felt it was generic and not helpfull and raised a complaint.
step 2: I'd get in touch with this student and ask them to explain why they thought my feedback was not up to standard for them.
step 3: Explain my feedback to them in simpler terms to show that it was not generic and make sure they understand it.
step 4 & 5: Ask to remove the post on socials and then talk about better ways to provide better feedback to them.
